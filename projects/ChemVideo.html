<p>During chemistry of sophomore year, we had an experiment that we were allowed to document, and present to the class. The objective of the experiment was to drop an egg down a tube from some decently high altitude, and using whatever material we could get at a super market, to prevent the egg from getting damaged. We had about 2 weeks to prepare, execute, and film the whole experiment. During the filming, we used our own cell phones to record any videos or segments of the experiment that we could, and I compiled everything and edited it together into one single video. Afterwards, I added in simple transitions and published it to YouTube.</p>

<p>It was one of my first experiences using a video editer, in this case I used Davinci Resolve, which was one of the free video editing softwares at the time. It was a little overwhelming seeing all the buttons and things that I can do in the software. I was able to look up a video and navigate through the interface, and finally load in all my video files, and starting cutting up each individual video. Although the video only used simple transitions and edits, it still turned out great for the class, and I was happy with both the result and the journey.</p>
