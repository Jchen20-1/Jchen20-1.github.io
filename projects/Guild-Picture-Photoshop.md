Every year, the guild that I am part of in a game called, "MapleStory" does a group photo of all the guild member's in game character models. We first use a community created website to load in all the item and character data from in game files. Then, individual players can go on and customize their character models to reflect how it looks like in game. Afterwards, players are able to download and export the png file, which I have collected, and combined in photoshop for the final product. The background map is an actual map in the game itself, and was chosen through a poll in the guild discord. 

This was done through simple skills and tools available in Adobe Photoshop. All I did was load in all the png files of all the character models, and make sure they are on a different layer than the background. All that's left to do was to simply space out each character model, and rotate the images to fit with the terrain of the background. In the end, I also put in a textbox where I wrote the name of the guild, and gave it a fancy font, and positioned the textbook in the top middle of the image. 

It was a very fun and simple project that I was able to do with just a few google searches, as well as a bit of playing around with Adobe Photoshop.
